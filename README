you will probably need to edit 'work':
blockfilename: plain text file, one domain per line
lockTime: how long to enforce a session - you cannot unlock before lockTime finishes
unlockTime: how long to unlock for - after unlockTime, the hosts file will lock again

to start blocking:
sudo ./work now

to stop blocking:
sudo ./work later
